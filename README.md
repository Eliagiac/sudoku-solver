# Python Sudoku Solver

**Note: This project is in the early stages of development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Sudoku Solver. This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient Sudoku Solver, along with a GUI made with PyQt5. 
All of the steps involved in solving a puzzle are explained visually and with text, and a series of navigation buttons allows users to move through the steps freely.
The solver features both known strategies and ideas that I came up with personally, adding a distinctive touch to the program's problem-solving techniques.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eliagiac/sudoku-solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the solver:

    ```bash
    python sudoku_solver.py
    ```

2. Use the GUI to input a Sudoku puzzle and let the solver work its magic!

(The solver currently does not accept user inputs, it uses a set of hard-coded puzzles.)

## Roadmap

- Implement more advanced solving techniques.
- Enhance GUI features and usability.
- Add explanations and step-by-step walkthroughs of a solution.
- Add ways to input puzzles manually.
- Add an option to scan a puzzle grid from a picture.
