# Python Sudoku Solver

**Note: This project is in the early stages of development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Sudoku Solver. This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient Sudoku Solver, along with a GUI made with PyQt5. 
All of the steps involved in solving a puzzle are explained visually and with text, and a series of navigation buttons allows users to move through the steps freely.
The solver features both known strategies and ideas that I came up with personally, adding a distinctive touch to the program's problem-solving techniques.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eliagiac/sudoku-solver.git
    ```

2. Install the PyQt5 package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the solver:

    ```bash
    python sudoku_solver.py
    ```

2. In the GUI, click on "Show solution" and let the solver work its magic! <br />

3. You can then use the navigation buttons to view explanations on the steps required to solve the puzzle. 

*The solver currently does not accept user inputs, it uses a set of example puzzles of varying difficulty.*

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement more advanced solving techniques.
- [ ] Enhance GUI features and usability.
- [x] Add explanations and step-by-step walkthroughs of a solution.
- [ ] Add ways to input puzzles manually.
- [ ] Add an option to scan a puzzle grid from a picture.
